S,Mod2GaloisMapPQM,"Given X/F such that Jac(X) is a PQM surface (O maximal for now), the 2-torsion A[2] is free of rank 1 as an O/2-module. Let Q be an O/2-basis element. Then we can write Q^sigma = a_sigma * Q for any sigma in GalF. We return the map GalF --> (O/2)^x, sigma |--> a_sigma where it factors through adjoining the 2-torsion field and the endomorphism field to F",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,338,,-1,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
